# IoT SOLAR PANEL MONITORING SYSTEM
Having studied BSc Instrumentation and Control Engineering, I understand Electrical Power utilisation. Some everyday home appliances can be sufficiently powered by simple solar panel systems. This can significantly reduce the electricity charges from mains supply. Solar energy is free and can be harnessed easily.

This project seeks to provide a solar panel system user with updated information about their system. The parameters checked are Voltage and Current level in the battery, the environmental light intensity and the real-time sensors readings. Periodic update to the user helps them to monitor their system and predict failure even before it occurs. This eliminates the tragic occurrence of unprecidented breakdown, especially in the event of Mains blackout.

This project uses a Raspberry pi pico Microcontroller to process the sensors' data and link it to the server.
